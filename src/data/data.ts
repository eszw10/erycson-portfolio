User authorization is handled securely with Auth.js, and the intuitive booking and reservation feature is powered by React Day Picker. Creating Sanctuary was an incredible learning experience, allowing me to dive deep into exciting Next.js concepts like React Server Components, Server Components, Client Components, Static Site Generation (SSG), Server-Side Rendering (SSR), understanding the server/client component boundary, exploring server actions for data mutations, and mastering Next.js's new hooks and middleware. It was a challenging and rewarding journey!",
